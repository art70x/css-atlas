# Lovable Prompt for re-creating

1. **CSS Atlas:** A comprehensive CSS property reference app for developers to understand syntax and values. Key features include a search bar to input CSS properties or features, detailed syntax explanations with code examples, a list of possible units and values, and a concise description of the property's use case. Use a sleek dark mode theme with vibrant syntax highlighting. **NO BACKEND**
2. Add modern CSS features (**container queries, scroll-snap, clamp(), color-mix(), etc.**) and extend the data store with CSS3 properties, functions, logical properties, and other contemporary capabilities.
3. Update **SEO meta tags** to reflect CSS Atlas naming and improved metadata.
4. Add final touches with **micro-interactions**, update on-page SEO, and implement **lazy loading** logic for data to improve Lighthouse score.
5. Add a **TODO.md** with future feature ideas (non-backend), a **README.md** detailing project overview and usage, and a **CONTRIBUTING.md** with contribution guidelines.

> Note: these prompts are slightly refined versions of original ones used for this app.
